title: "MCP servers as a primitive"
description: "Ship MCP server configuration with your APM package so consumers get it wired into every harness on apm install."
---

When a consumer runs `apm install` against your package, the
`dependencies.mcp:` block in your `apm.yml` becomes their MCP server
config. No README copy-paste, no per-harness JSON. This page is the producer side of
[Install MCP servers](../../../consumer/install-mcp-servers/).

## One-line answer

Add a `dependencies.mcp:` section to your package's `apm.yml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  mcp:
    - io.github.github/github-mcp-server
```

On the consumer's machine, `apm install <your-package>` writes this
into every detected harness's MCP config file.

## What "MCP as a primitive" means here

[Primitives and targets](../../../concepts/primitives-and-targets/)
lists MCP servers as a primitive APM routes per target. Unlike
`.apm/skills/` or `.apm/prompts/`, MCP servers do not live as files in
your package -- they live as **declarations** in `apm.yml`. APM
materialises them at install time into the harness-specific config
file (see the per-harness map in
[Install MCP servers](../../../consumer/install-mcp-servers/#what-apm-install-writes-to-disk)).

You declare once. At project scope, APM writes `.vscode/mcp.json`,
`.cursor/mcp.json`, `.mcp.json` for Claude, `.codex/config.toml`, and the
rest -- whichever harnesses the consumer has.

## The `mcp:` schema

Each entry under `dependencies.mcp:` (or `devDependencies.mcp:`) is
either a bare string or a mapping. Fields, from
`src/apm_cli/models/dependency/mcp.py`:

| Field | Required when | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | always (mapping form) | Matches `^[a-zA-Z0-9@_][a-zA-Z0-9._@/:=-]{0,127}$`. |
| `transport` | self-defined | One of `stdio`, `http`, `sse`, `streamable-http`. |
| `command` | self-defined `stdio` | Single binary path; no whitespace (use `args`). |
| `args` | optional | List for self-defined; dict for registry overlays. |
| `url` | self-defined `http`/`sse`/`streamable-http` | `http://` or `https://` only. |
| `env` | optional, stdio | Map of env vars passed to the child process. |
| `headers` | optional, remote | Map of HTTP headers. CR/LF rejected. |
| `tools` | optional | Allowlist of tool names. Default `["*"]`. |
| `version` | optional | Pin a registry server version. |
| `registry` | optional | `false` = self-defined; URL = custom registry. |
| `package` | optional | `npm`, `pypi`, or `oci` for registry-resolved servers. |

Three forms cover every case:

```yaml
dependencies:
  mcp:
    # 1. Registry reference -- resolved from api.mcp.github.com
    - io.github.github/github-mcp-server

    # 2. Self-defined stdio
    - name: filesystem
      registry: false
      transport: stdio
      command: npx
      args: ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/workspace"]

    # 3. Self-defined remote
    - name: linear
      registry: false
      transport: http
      url: https://mcp.linear.app/sse
      headers:
        Authorization: "Bearer ${LINEAR_TOKEN}"
```

## What the consumer sees on install

For each detected harness, APM writes the relevant MCP config file.
The full mapping (file path, scope, JSON/TOML schema) is in
[Install MCP servers](../../../consumer/install-mcp-servers/#what-apm-install-writes-to-disk).
You do not need to know it to author -- APM handles the per-target
translation.

The consumer can run `apm mcp list` to confirm the server landed in
each runtime they care about.

## Secrets: never commit, always indirect

Treat `apm.yml` like `package.json`: it is committed, reviewed, and
shipped. Do not embed tokens. Two patterns work:

```yaml
# Env-var indirection -- resolved by APM or the harness per target
- name: linear
  registry: false
  transport: http
  url: https://mcp.linear.app/sse
  headers:
    Authorization: "Bearer ${LINEAR_TOKEN}"

# Stdio env -- use ${VAR} for indirection from the installer environment
- name: my-internal
  registry: false
  transport: stdio
  command: my-server
  env:
    API_TOKEN: "${MY_API_TOKEN}"
```

Headers and env values are never shell-expanded by APM. For harnesses
that support runtime env placeholders (for example VS Code and Kiro),
APM preserves the placeholder so the harness resolves it when the
server starts or the request is made. For harnesses that require
literal values (for example Claude Code and Codex self-defined stdio
env), APM resolves `${VAR}` from the install process environment,
prompts interactively when the terminal is attached, and leaves
unresolved placeholders unchanged in non-interactive installs. Keep the
real secret in the consumer's environment (or their secret manager).

The `github-mcp-server` is a special case: APM injects an
`Authorization: Bearer <token>` header automatically when it writes
the Copilot CLI config. See
[Token injection](../../../consumer/install-mcp-servers/#token-injection-github-mcp-server).

When a registry server marks an env/input variable optional, APM does
not generate a prompt or runtime config entry unless a value is already
available. See the
[manifest schema reference](../../../reference/manifest-schema/#424-variable-references-in-headers-and-env)
for the canonical per-target and required-vs-optional rules.

## Direct vs transitive: the trust boundary

A self-defined MCP server (`registry: false`) declared by your package
is trusted only when your package is a **direct** dependency of the
consumer. If your package is pulled in transitively, APM warns and
**skips** the MCP entry unless the consumer passes
`--trust-transitive-mcp`. Source:
`src/apm_cli/integration/mcp_integrator_install.py` and
`src/apm_cli/integration/mcp_integrator.py`.

Implications for producers:

- Registry-resolved servers (form 1 above) flow through transitively
  without a trust prompt -- they are vetted by the registry.
- Self-defined `stdio` and remote servers should be reserved for
  things the consumer would expect from a direct dependency.
- Document any self-defined MCP server in your README so a transitive
  consumer knows what they would be trusting.

For the full trust model, see
[Lifecycle](../../../concepts/lifecycle/) and
[Security](../../../enterprise/security/).

## Pitfalls

- **Whitespace in `command`**: APM does not split on spaces. Put the
  binary in `command` and arguments in `args`. Validation rejects
  `command: "npx -y server"` with a fix-it message.
- **Hard-coded paths**: `command: /Users/me/bin/server` works on your
  laptop and nowhere else. Prefer a binary on `PATH` (`npx`, `uvx`)
  or a runtime-installed package.
- **`url:` with non-`http(s)` scheme**: rejected at parse time.
  WebSocket and `file://` are not supported transports.
- **Embedded tokens in `headers` or `env` literals**: a reviewer will
  see them. Use `${VAR}` indirection.
- **Forgetting `devDependencies.mcp:`**: an MCP server you only need
  for development (a local mock, a debug bridge) belongs in
  `devDependencies.mcp:`. `apm pack` excludes it; consumers do not
  get it. See
  [dev-only primitives](../../../concepts/primitives-and-targets/#dev-only-primitives).

## Next

- Bundle other primitives alongside MCP servers --

  [hooks and commands](../hooks-and-commands/).
- Pack and ship -- [Pack a bundle](../../pack-a-bundle/).
