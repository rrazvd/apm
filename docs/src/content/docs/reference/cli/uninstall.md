description: Remove an APM package from the project

Remove one or more APM packages from `apm.yml`, the lockfile, `apm_modules/`, and every deployed primitive across all configured harnesses.

## Synopsis

```bash
apm uninstall [OPTIONS] PACKAGES...
```

## Description

`apm uninstall` is the inverse of `apm install <package>`. It strips a package from the manifest, deletes its source from `apm_modules/`, prunes any transitive dependencies that nothing else depends on, and removes every file the package deployed into harness folders (Copilot, Claude, Cursor, Codex, Gemini, OpenCode, Windsurf).

The command only deletes files tracked in the lockfile's `deployed_files` manifest, so hand-authored content in the same harness folders is left alone.

## Arguments

| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| `PACKAGES...` | One or more packages to remove. Accepts shorthand (`owner/repo`), HTTPS URL, SSH URL, FQDN, or marketplace notation (`name@marketplace`). APM resolves each to the canonical identity stored in `apm.yml`. Required. |

## Options

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--dry-run` | Show what would be removed without touching disk. Registry fallback for marketplace notation is skipped. |
| `-v, --verbose` | Show detailed removal information. |
| `-g, --global` | Remove from the user scope (`~/.apm/`) instead of the current project. |

## Examples

Remove one package:

```bash
apm uninstall acme/my-package
```

Remove several at once:

```bash
apm uninstall org/pkg1 org/pkg2
```

Preview the removal without writing to disk:

```bash
apm uninstall acme/my-package --dry-run
```

Remove from the user scope:

```bash
apm uninstall -g acme/my-package
```

Remove by marketplace name (resolved via lockfile, then registry):

```bash
apm uninstall my-plugin@official
```

Resolve via URL (same identity as the shorthand):

```bash
apm uninstall https://github.com/acme/my-package.git
```

## Behavior

What gets removed, in order:

1. The package entry in `apm.yml` under `dependencies.apm` or `devDependencies.apm`.
2. The package folder under `apm_modules/owner/repo/`.
3. Transitive dependencies that no remaining package depends on (npm-style pruning, computed from `apm.lock.yaml`). A transitive dependency still declared by any surviving package is preserved, even when two packages share it (a diamond-shaped install). If a surviving package's manifest can't be read, APM keeps every remaining candidate for that run rather than guessing -- re-run with `--verbose` to see which manifest failed, then fix or restore it and re-run to complete cleanup.
4. Every file in the lockfile's `deployed_files` for the removed packages and pruned orphans, across all harness folders (`.github/`, `.claude/`, `.cursor/`, `.opencode/`, `.gemini/`, `.codex/`, `.windsurf/`, `.kiro/`).
5. Hook entries inside `.claude/settings.json`, `.cursor/hooks.json`, `.gemini/settings.json`, and `.kiro/hooks/` that the removed packages contributed. Remaining packages -- including transitive dependencies still required by another package -- have their hook entries rebuilt from the post-removal lockfile.
6. MCP servers contributed only by the removed packages.
7. The lockfile entries themselves. If no dependencies remain, `apm.lock.yaml` is deleted.
8. Empty parent directories left behind by the cleanup.

If a name passed on the command line is not found in `apm.yml`, the command warns and continues with the rest. If none of the names match, it exits without changes.

If a marketplace ref cannot be resolved (neither the lockfile nor the registry has a matching entry), APM logs an error and skips that package. Use `owner/repo` notation to uninstall directly, or run `apm list` to find the canonical name.

### Supply-chain guard

When marketplace notation (`name@marketplace`) falls through to the registry (Stage 2), APM refuses any canonical the registry returns that is not already recorded in `apm.lock.yaml`. The refusal is reported as a warning naming the resolved canonical so you can decide whether to re-run with `apm uninstall owner/repo` directly. This prevents a poisoned marketplace registry from coercing APM into removing an unrelated installed package.

### `#ref` is not meaningful for `uninstall`

`apm install` accepts an optional `#ref` fragment (`apm install NAME@MKT#ref`) to pin a specific revision. `apm uninstall` identifies packages by canonical name only, so any `#ref` fragment supplied with marketplace notation (e.g. `my-plugin@official#v1.0.0`) is ignored.

### No-lockfile behavior

If `apm.lock.yaml` is not present, marketplace notation has no offline anchor: Stage 1 finds nothing, and the supply-chain guard cannot cross-check the registry result. APM still attempts registry resolution and proceeds if the canonical matches an entry in `apm.yml`, but this path has weaker integrity guarantees. Prefer `owner/repo` form when there is no lockfile, or run `apm install` to regenerate the lockfile first.

`--dry-run` runs steps 1-3 in memory and prints the plan; nothing is written. Registry fallback is also skipped in dry-run mode, so marketplace refs not already in the lockfile cannot be previewed; use `owner/repo` notation or re-run without `--dry-run`.
