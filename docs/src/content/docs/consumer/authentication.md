description: Install public packages with no setup; add one env var or use your git credential helper for any private host -- GitHub, GitLab, Azure DevOps, Bitbucket, Gitea, or self-hosted.
---

APM resolves dependencies from any git host you can `git clone` from. Public packages on github.com need zero setup. Other hosts -- GitHub Enterprise, GitLab (SaaS or self-managed), Azure DevOps, Bitbucket, Gitea, or any self-hosted git server -- need either one env var or your existing git credential helper.

```bash
apm install
```

## The 30-second answer

Pick the path that matches your dependencies:

- **All public github.com packages.** Do nothing.
- **Private github.com / GHE.com / GHES packages.** Either run `gh auth login` (recommended) or set `GITHUB_APM_PAT`.
- **GitLab packages (SaaS or self-managed).** Set `GITLAB_APM_PAT`, or rely on your `git credential` helper.
- **Azure DevOps packages.** Run `az login`, or set `ADO_APM_PAT`.
- **Bitbucket, Gitea, or any other git host.** Use your existing `git credential` helper -- if `git clone <url>` works in your shell, `apm install` works too.

That covers the consumer case. The rest of this page expands each path.

## Already signed in with `gh`?

If you have run `gh auth login` and you can do `gh repo clone <your-org>/<repo>`,
APM picks that up automatically. There is nothing else to set.

Under the hood, APM calls `gh auth token --hostname <host>` after the
env-var lookups; if `gh` is not installed or not logged in for the host,
it is silently skipped.

## Setting `GITHUB_APM_PAT`

If you prefer an explicit token (CI, devcontainers, scripts):

```bash
export GITHUB_APM_PAT=ghp_your_token
apm install
```

Use a fine-grained or classic PAT with **read** access to the repos your
manifest references. For an org's private repos, the PAT must be
authorized for that org.

For the org-private case, see [Private and org packages](../private-and-org-packages/).

## GitLab (SaaS or self-managed)

**If `git clone` works, `apm install` works** -- no token is needed for GitLab `path:` files.

APM fetches `path:`-specified files from GitLab dependencies via git
sparse/partial checkout (the same transport used for the clone), so your
existing SSH keys and git credential helpers work without any extra token.
This is the default for all GitLab sources, including self-hosted instances
where the REST API is restricted or returns 410 -- if `git clone` works, so
does `apm install`. For self-hosted hosts, explicit `git:` / SSH URLs carry
the host in the dependency. Set `GITLAB_HOST` (or `APM_GITLAB_HOSTS`) only
when you want bare-host or shorthand forms to classify as GitLab.

If you need to fall back to the GitLab REST API (for environments where git
transport is not available), set `GITLAB_APM_PAT`:

```bash
export GITLAB_APM_PAT=glpat_your_token
apm install
```

Use a project- or group-scoped token with **read_repository** scope. Self-managed GitLab works with the same env var; APM resolves the host from the dependency URL.

If you have configured a git credential helper for GitLab (e.g. `git credential-manager` on Windows / macOS), APM falls back to it after the env-var lookup -- you do not need `GITLAB_APM_PAT` if `git clone https://gitlab.com/<your-group>/<repo>` already prompts you once and caches.

`GITLAB_TOKEN` is also accepted as a lower-precedence fallback for compatibility with CI environments that already set it.

## Azure DevOps

If a dependency lives on `dev.azure.com/...`:

```bash
az login --tenant <your-tenant-id>
apm install
```

Or, if you cannot use `az`:

```bash
export ADO_APM_PAT=your_ado_pat
apm install
```

ADO is always auth-required -- there is no anonymous fallback.

## Bitbucket, Gitea, and any other git host

For any git host APM does not have a platform-specific PAT for -- Bitbucket Cloud or Server, Gitea, self-hosted Forgejo, an enterprise git mirror -- APM resolves credentials through the same `git credential` helper your shell uses.

```bash
git clone https://your-host.example.com/team/repo.git  # cache the credential once
apm install                                             # APM picks up the cached credential
```

There is no APM-specific env var for these hosts by design: if you can `git clone`, APM can install. Configure your credential helper once (`git credential-manager`, Keychain, libsecret, plain-text store -- whatever your shell uses) and `apm install` follows the same path git already trusts.

For non-interactive environments (CI, devcontainers), set the credential through your CI's secret store and configure `git config --global credential.helper store` against a runtime-injected `~/.git-credentials` file.

## Going further

Token scopes, SSO authorization, Enterprise Managed Users (EMU), GHES hostnames, multi-org `GITHUB_APM_PAT_{ORG}` setups, GitLab self-managed FQDN routing, and the ADO bearer fallback are covered in the [enterprise authentication](../../enterprise/security/) page.

For how a token is used once resolved, see [Private and org packages](../private-and-org-packages/).
