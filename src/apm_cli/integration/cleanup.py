"""Shared cleanup helper for stale deployed files.

Used by the post-install cleanup blocks in :mod:`apm_cli.commands.install`
to remove files previously deployed for a still-present package that the
current install no longer produces (e.g. after a rename or removal inside
the package). Centralises the safety gates so both the local-package and
remote-package cleanup paths apply the same rules.

Safety gates, in order:

1. **Path validation** -- :meth:`BaseIntegrator.validate_deploy_path` rejects
   path traversal and any path not under a known integration prefix.
2. **Directory handling** -- APM-managed primitives are file-keyed
   (``SKILL.md`` for skills, individual ``.prompt.md`` / ``.instructions.md``
   files elsewhere). Directory entries that match a known skill directory
   pattern (``<prefix>/skills/<name>``) are deferred to a second pass so
   individual files are removed first; if the directory is then empty (or
   only contains APM-tracked files with matching hashes) it is safely
   removed. Non-skill directory entries are still rejected as untrusted.
3. **Provenance check** -- when the previous lockfile recorded a content
   hash for the file, the on-disk content must still match. If the user
   edited the file after APM deployed it the hash will differ and the
   deletion is skipped with a warning. Files without a recorded hash
   (legacy lockfiles) fall through and are deleted, preserving prior
   behaviour.

The helper records cleanup diagnostics via *diagnostics* (collect-then-
render) and returns a :class:`CleanupResult` summarizing deleted, failed,
and skipped paths. Callers remain responsible for any informational,
progress, or warning logging based on that result -- the helper itself
takes no logger.
